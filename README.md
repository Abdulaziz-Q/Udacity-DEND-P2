### Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.

They'd like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. 
My role is to create a database for this analysis. 

### Project Overview
In this project, I will apply what I have learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python.
To complete the project, I will need to model my data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. 

### Datasets
For this project, I will be working with one dataset: **event_data**. 

**event_datafile_new.csv** file contains all data in the **event_data** 

### Project File
**Project_1B_ Project_Template.ipynb** is jupyter notebook file that contains the project.
